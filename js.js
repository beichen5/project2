                Yangxin County, an old man, his family lives in this county Caidian. This village is five or six miles away from the county. The father and son opened a small roadside store, dedicated to the passing merchants' accommodation. There are a few carriage drivers, selling things to and from, who often live in this store. One day at sunset, four drivers came to stay in the store, but the store was already full of people. They estimated that there was nowhere else to go and insisted on staying. The old man thought for a while and thought of a place to stay, but was afraid that the guests would not be satisfied. The guests said, "Any hut will do, don't dare to pick." At that time, the old man's daughter-in-law had just died and her body was parked in a hut, while his son had gone out to buy a coffin and had not yet returned. The old man felt that the place where the hearse was set up was empty and the road was not easy to find, so he led the guest to the small house by himself.
                The guests entered the house and saw a dim oil lamp on the table, a top tent behind the table, and a paper quilt covering the deceased. And look at their place of residence, it is in the small room in the bunk. The four of them were tired of running all the way, very sleepy, head just put on the pillow, and fell asleep. Only one of them is still hazy and not sleepy, suddenly heard a sound on the bed of the spirit, quickly opened his eyes to see the bright lights in front of the spirit, and to see things clearly. I saw the female corpse lifted the quilt and got up, then got out of bed and slowly entered their living room. The female corpse's face is light gold, forehead tied with raw silk, walked to the front of the store, leaned over to each person and blew three breaths. The guests were terrified, lest blow on their own, secretly cover their heads with the quilt, not even dare to breathe, quietly listening. Not long, the female corpse really came over, like blowing others also blew him three mouths. He felt that the corpse had gone out of the room, and heard the sound of paper, before reaching out to peek, and saw the corpse lying there as it was. The guest was too scared to make a sound, and secretly stomped on the other three with his feet, but the three did not move. He could not do anything, he thought he might as well put on his clothes and run away! Just get up to get the clothes, the sound of chug-chug again. This guest quickly retracted his head back into the quilt, thinking the female corpse came over again, blowing him several times before leaving. Less stay a while, hear the bed again, know that the female corpse is lying down again. He slowly felt in the quilt to put on the clothes, jerked up, barefooted and ran outside. At this time the female corpse also got up, as if to chase him. By the time she left the tent, the guest had opened the door and ran out, followed by the female corpse.
                The customer ran and shouted, but no one in the village heard. He wanted to knock on the shopkeeper's door, but he was afraid he would be too late to be caught up by the corpse, so he ran as fast as he could down the road leading to the county seat. When he reached the eastern suburbs, he saw a temple and heard the sound of knocking wooden fish, and the customer knocked sharply on the temple door. But the monk in surprise, think the situation was unusual, refused to open the door in time for him to enter. He turned back to the female corpse has been chased to, still only a foot away. The guest was more afraid. Outside the temple gate there is a large aspen tree, the tree has a circumference of four or five feet, he used the tree to block the body. The female corpse from the right he came to the left to hide, from the left to the right to hide, the more angry the female corpse. At this time both sides are sweating and very tired. The female corpse stood still, and the guest was panting, and took refuge behind a tree. Suddenly, the female corpse rose up, stretching out both arms across the tree to catch the customer. The guest was immediately stunned. The female corpse failed to catch the man, holding the tree stood frozen there.
                The monk listened for a long time, listening to no movement outside the temple, only slowly out of the temple door. See the guest lying on the ground, take a light, already dead. But feel the heart, there was still a little beating, carried to the temple, the whole night, the guest woke up. He fed him some soup and asked him what was wrong. The guest told the whole story. By this time, the temple bell had already struck the morning, and it was already dawn. The monk went out to look at the tree, and saw a female corpse standing there. The monk was horrified and immediately reported to the magistrate. The magistrate himself came to examine the corpse, and asked people to pull the two hands of the female corpse, inserted firmly, so they could not be pulled out. A closer look, the corpse of the four fingers of the left and right hands are like steel hooks deep into the tree, even the nails are inserted. And asked a few people to pull hard, before pulling out, only to see her nails into the traces like chiseled holes. The magistrate ordered the magistrate to go to the old man's store to inquire, only to learn that the female corpse is gone, the other three customers have died, people are talking about. The magistrate told the old man the reason, and the old man followed the magistrate to the temple and carried the female corpse back.
                The guest cried and said to the magistrate, "The four of us came out together, and now I am going back alone, how can I make the villagers believe me?" The magistrate then wrote him a letter of proof and gave him some silver to send him back.

                Shen Linsheng said: his friend, an old man, during summer nap, in a haze, saw a woman lift the curtain into the house, wrapped in white cloth, wearing mourning clothes, but to the inner room. The old man thought to himself that it might be a woman from a neighbor's house who was looking for his wife. But then he thought, why wear unlucky clothes to go to someone's home? Just wondering, the woman has come out of the house. He took a closer look. The woman is about thirty years old, yellowish swollen face, eyebrows very unstretchable, look terrible. The woman hesitated and gradually approached the old man's bed. The old man pretended to be asleep to see what was going to happen.
                Not long after, the woman lifted the dress and walked on the bed, pressed on the old man's stomach, the old man felt a few hundred pounds. Although the heart understands everything, but wants to raise their hands, hands like being bound; want to lift the feet, feet can not move. Desperate to shout for help, and struggled to shout out. Then, the woman used her mouth to sniff his face, cheeks, nose, eyebrows, forehead, all sniffed again. The old man felt her mouth like cold ice, cold air through the bones. He was in a hurry and wanted to wait for her to sniff his cheeks when she bit her hard. The old man took advantage of the situation to bite her cheekbone, and his teeth were bitten into the flesh. The woman felt pain, wanting to rush away, one side struggling, one side crying. But the more the old man bit, intuitive blood flowing through the cheeks, soaked the pillow.
                When the two struggling, heard his wife's voice in the yard, the old man shouted: "A ghost!" A loose mouth, the woman has drifted away. The wife ran into the house and saw nothing, but laughed at him for having a nightmare. The old man described the strange incident in detail, and said there is blood on the pillow as evidence. Two people check, there is indeed something like water leaking from the house, dripping wet pillows and mats. Get down and sniff, fishy smell unusual. The old man vomited with nausea, and after a few days, there were remnants of the stench in his mouth.

                There is a person whose family named Xu, living in the north of Zichuan County, to fish for a living. He always brings wine to the river every evening, while drinking and fishing. And before drinking, and always first pour a cup of sacrifice, and prayed: "The drowned ghost in the river, please come to drink!" This became a habit. Other people tend to play very little fish, while he played full baskets of fish every day. One evening, Xv had just been drinking alone when he saw a young boy approaching and circling around him. Xv asked him to drink with him, and the teenager did not resist, and they drank together. This night even failed to catch a fish, Xv is very frustrated. The young man stood up and bowed and said, "I will go downstream to catch fish for you." Said, towards the downstream floating away. A while later, the young man returned and said, "A big school of fish is coming!" Sure enough, the sound of many fish swallowing bait was heard. Xv  then cast the net, a net caught a dozen feet long large fish. He was very happy and thanked the young man. When the young man wanted to leave, Xv gave him the fish, but the young man did not want it and said, "I have drunk your good wine many times, how can I say thank you for this small thing? If you don't mind the trouble, I will come to you often." Xv said, "How can you say that many times when you have only met for one night? If you would like to come and help me, I would like to do so, but how can I repay your kindness?" So he asked the young man his name. The young man said, "My surname is Wang, I don't have a name, you can call me Wang Liu Lang." After that, he said goodbye and left. The next day, Xv sold the fish and bought more wine by the way. That night, Xv came to the river. Liu Lang has been waiting for a long time, and the two will drink. After drinking a few glasses, Liu Lang will catch fish for Xv.
                So half a year has passed. One day, Liu Lang suddenly said to Xv: "You and I know each other, like brothers, but we will soon be separated." He said very sad. Xv was very surprised and asked him why he was like that, and he thought twice before saying, "Since you and I are like brothers, you don't have to be surprised if I tell you. Now that we are going to part, I can tell you the truth: I am actually a ghost, only because I drowned after drinking too much wine before I was born, it has been several years. In the past, you caught more fish than others because I secretly helped you to drive them away, as a reward for the wine. Tomorrow my time limit is up, someone will replace me, I will be born on earth, you and I will meet only tonight, so I can not calm. Xv was at first very frightened to hear this, but, because he had been together for a long time, he was no longer frightened, but sad. So he poured a cup full of wine and held it in his hand, saying, "Liu Lang, I toast you with this cup of wine! I hope you won't be sad when you drink it. Although it is sad that we can no longer see each other, I should congratulate you for being relieved of your disaster. Don't be sad, you should be happy!" So, they continued to drink. Xv asked Liu Lang, "Who has come to replace you?" Liu Lang said, "Brother, you can wait in the shade by the river tomorrow, just at noon, a woman will cross the river and drown. When they heard the village chicken crowing, they shed tears and said goodbye. The next day, Xv watched secretly at the river, what would happen. At noon, a woman carrying a baby fell into the water when she reached the river. The baby was thrown on the shore, hands up and feet crying. Women several times floating on the sink, and then actually drenched the river bank, sitting on the ground after a short rest, picking up the baby and going. When Xv saw the woman fell into the water, very intolerant, wanted to rescue, but thought that this is the double of Liu Lang, before the idea of saving people. When he saw that the woman did not drown, his heart suspected that what Liu Lang said was a bit absurd. That night, Xv still went to the same place to go fishing, and Liu Lang, who has long been there, said: "Now we are together again, can not say separate things for the time being." Xv asked Rulang what happened during the day, and Liu Lang said, "The woman was supposed to take my place, but I took pity on the baby in her arms and couldn't bear to hurt the lives of two people for myself alone. Therefore, I decided to give up this opportunity, but I do not know when there will be a substitute for the dead. Maybe it's because you and I are not yet finished." Xv sighed and said, "Your kind heart can always move the Jade Emperor." From then on, they continued to drink and fish. After a few days, Liu Lang came again to say goodbye to Xv, Xv thought there was another replacement for Liu Lang. Liu Lang said, "No, my previous kindness really touched the Jade Emperor, so I was recruited as the land god of Wu Town in Zhaoyuan County. Tomorrow, go to work, if you do not forget our friendship, do not mind the distance, go to Zhaoyuan to see me." Xv congratulated me and said, "I am very pleased that my brother has become a god because of his upright behavior. But people and gods are far apart, even if I am not afraid of the long way, how can I see you?" Liu Lang said, "Just go, don't worry about it." He went away with repeated instructions. 
                When Xv returned home, he wanted to pack his clothes and go east to Zhaoyuan. His wife laughed and said, "This trip is hundreds of miles, even if there is this place, I'm afraid and a clay idol can not talk." Xv did not listen, and finally went to Zhaoyuan. He asked the local residents, and there was indeed a Wu town. When he found Wuzhen, he stayed in a guest house and asked the owner where the land shrine was. The host was amazed and said, "Is your surname Xv?" Xv said, "Yes, but how do you know?" The owner of the store asked again, "Is the guest from Zichuan?" Xv said: "Yes, but how do you know?" The shopkeeper did not answer and quickly walked out. After a while, only to see the husband holding a small child, girls and daughters-in-law peeking outside the door, the village people have come to look around Xv, such as four walls. Xv was even more amazed. People told him: "A few nights ago, I dreamed that the gods came to tell me: there is a Zichuan surnamed Xv to come here, can give some financial support. So wait here for a long time." Xv was very strange, so he went to the land ancestral shrine to worship Liu Lang, prayed: "Since we parted from you, I remembered in my sleep, so I came all the way to the appointment of the past. I am very grateful to you for telling the people of the village in your dream. I am ashamed that I have no gift to give you, but only a cup of wine. If you don't mind, I will drink with you as I used to do by the river." After the prayer, he burned some paper money. A moment later, I saw a whirlwind after the throne of the gods, rotating for a long time before dissipating. That night, Xv dreamed that Liu Lang had come, well-dressed, very different from the past. Liu Lang thanked him, "I am glad and sad that you have come all the way to see me. But now I have a job to do, so I can't meet you. I am near but far away from the mountains and rivers. The people in the village have given me a small gift as a token of appreciation for my old friends. When you go back, I will come to see you off." Xv stayed for a few days and intended to return home, but everyone diligently stayed and took turns to be the host for Xv's farewell every morning and evening. Xv resolutely said goodbye, the village people scrambled to send a lot of gifts to fill up his traveling clothes. In less than a day, the gifts filled his bag, and men, women and children all gathered to send Xu out of the village. Suddenly a whirlwind came up and followed Xv for more than ten miles. Xu bowed to the whirlwind again and said, "Liu Lang, take care, don't send me far. You have a heart of love, naturally for the benefit of the people on the side, no need for old friends to instruct." The whirlwind hovered for a long time before leaving. The people in the village also sighed and returned. Xv returned home, the family is a little more affluent, they no longer fish. Later, when he met people from Zhaoyuan and asked them about the land, he was said to be as spiritual as the legend said, and was known far and wide.
                The different historians said, "Wang Liulang is a god in the midst of the green clouds, but he still does not forget his friends when he was poor, that is why he is so divine. Do you still know the man in the hat who is sitting in the car today? There was a retired man in my township whose family was very poor. He had a friend who had been with him since he was a child, and now he is a distinguished man. He wanted to go to him and he thought he would be taken care of. So he did his best to pack and travel thousands of miles, only to come back very disappointed; he spent all the money in his bag and sold his horse before he could return. His brother, who was a very witty man, composed a song called "The Moon" to mock this incident, saying: 'This month, when my brother came back, his ermine hat was untied, his carriage and horse umbrella were not opened, and his horse became a donkey, and his boots were silent.' Read this for a laugh."

                When Xie Qian revolted, all the official residences were turned into "thieves' dens". There was a scholar named Wang Qixiang, whose house had more "thieves" gathered. After the government soldiers broke into the city, they swept the thieves and filled the steps with dead bodies and blood flowed through the door. Wang learned the ambassador came into the city, back home, ordered people to carry the corpse out, to wash the blood stains, and only then live. But in the daytime I often see ghosts, the night under the bed phosphorus fires are flying, the walls are often ghosts crying, very restless.
                One day, a scholar named Wang Haodi borrowed to live in the house of Wang Gong. During the night, he heard a small voice calling out under his bed: "Hao Di! Haoudi!" After a while, the voice grew louder and said, "I'm dying so hard!" Then he cried, and then there were cries all over the courtyard. When Wang Gong heard this, he went to Wang Sheng's house with his sword in hand and said loudly, "Don't you know that I am Wang College?" Only to hear the ghosts snicker and sneer.
                Wang Gong had no choice but to set up a water and land dojo, ordered monks, Taoist priests chanting sutras to overtake, and at night made rice and threw it into the courtyard for the ghosts to eat. At this time, you can see the courtyard phosphorus fire everywhere.
                Previously, a man surnamed Wang, who was looking after the gate for Wang Gong, was very sick and had been unconscious for several days. On the day of the haunting, he suddenly stretched his body, as if he had woken up. When his wife saw this, she brought him food, but he said, "I don't know why the master just gave food in the courtyard, but I also ate with the group, so I didn't feel hungry."
                Since then, the ghosts have been extinct. Could it be that the Taoist priests played music, the monks transcended, and the alms were really spiritual?
                Ishiji said, "All ghosts and monsters can be eliminated only by virtue of sublime virtue. When the city was attacked, the king learned to make the ambassador so powerful that others were afraid of him. However, the ghosts mocked and insulted him. Must these ghosts have already predicted that he would not end up well? I would like to advise you, sirs, that if you can't scare the ghosts by treating them like human beings, please don't scare them by looking like ghosts! "

                There was a scholar surnamed Wang who went out early in the morning and met a woman on the road, carrying a bundle in her arms and running alone, with a very difficult gait. He saw that she was fifteen or sixteen years old and very beautiful, so he fell in love with her. He asked the woman, "Why are you walking alone early in the morning?" The woman said, "People in a hurry can not be a companion to relieve sorrow, why bother to ask more?" Wang Sheng said, "What do you have sorrow to say, maybe I can be effective, will not resist." The woman looked miserable and said, "My parents were greedy for money and sold me to a rich family, and my first wife was very jealous of me. Wang Sheng asked, "Where are you going to go?" The woman said, "I'm a fugitive and a stranger, and I don't have a place to go." Wang Sheng said, "My home is not far from here, as long as you are willing, you can make a temporary stay." The woman happily agreed. Wang Sheng helped her carry the bag and led her to the house. When the woman saw that there was no one else in the house, she asked, "Why don't you have any family members?" Wang Sheng replied, "This is my study." The woman said, "This is a good place, if you take pity on me and let me live on, you must keep it a secret and not talk about it to others." Wang Sheng was full of promise, so he lived with her. Wang Sheng let her hide in the secret room, and after many days no one knew. Later, Wang Sheng whispered this to his wife Chen, who suspected that the woman was a concubine of a large family and advised her husband to send her away, but Wang Sheng simply did not listen.
                By chance, Wang Sheng was in the city and ran into a Taoist priest, who, upon seeing him, showed a stunned look. He asked him, "What have you met?" Wang Sheng said, "I haven't met anything." The Taoist priest said, "You are surrounded by evil energy, how can you say you haven't met anything?" Wang Sheng argued strongly. The Taoist priest had to leave, and when he was leaving, he said with regret: "I'm so confused! There are people in this world who do not realize that the time of death is approaching!" Wang Sheng, because of his words, had to suspect the woman. And then thought, obviously a beautiful girl, how can it be a demon, guess it is a Taoist monk to suppress the demons to earn a little money for food? A moment's work, he returned to the study, a push on the door, found inside inserted, can not enter. So I got suspicious, and went in over the wall, and the door was shut tight. He crept to the window and peeked inside, only to see an evil ghost, green face, jagged teeth like jagged teeth. The ghost laid a human skin on the bed, holding a colored pen on the top of the tracing, soon finished, throwing the pen aside, and then hands will be lifted up the human skin draped on the body, and in a moment transformed into a woman. Seeing this scene, Wang Sheng was scared to death. Not daring to say a word, like a dog crawling out of the body, panicked to catch up with the Taoist priest. However, the Taoist priest had long since disappeared. He went looking everywhere and finally ran into the field. Wang Sheng threw himself on his knees and begged the Taoist priest for help. The Taoist priest said: "Let me drive it away for you. In fact, this ghost is also very poor, it is difficult to find a substitute, I can not bear to hurt its life." So he handed the fly whisk to Wang Sheng and told him to take it back and hang it on his bedroom door, and when he parted ways, he agreed to meet him at the Qingdi Temple.
                Wang Sheng returned home, did not dare to go to the study, and slept in the inner room at night, and hung the fly whisk given to him by the Taoist priest on the door. At about one o'clock, he heard the sound of JI JI outside the door. Wang Sheng himself did not dare to look, but asked his wife to peek, only to see the woman came, looking at the fly whisk on the door and did not dare to enter the house. The woman gnashed her teeth outside the door and stood for a long time before leaving. After a few moments, she came back and cursed, "The Taoist priest is scaring me, I can't just spit out the food I ate in my mouth!" So he took down the fly whisk and broke it, and broke into Wang Sheng's bed, cut open Wang Sheng's intestines and belly, and grabbed his heart with both hands and left. Wang Sheng's wife was so frightened that she cried out. The maid came in with a candle and saw that Wang Sheng was dead and his chest was blurred with blood, and Chen was too scared to even cry out.
                The next day, Wang Sheng's brother Erlang was called to tell the Taoist priest. The Taoist priest was furious and said, "I had mercy on it, how dare it do this!" Immediately, he followed Erlang and rushed. But the woman was nowhere to be found. The Taoist priest looked up and looked around and said, "Fortunately, it has not gone far." And he asked, "Whose family lives in the south courtyard?" Erlang said, "I live there." The Taoist priest said, "It is now in your house." Erlang was surprised to hear that it was not. The Taoist priest asked again, "Did a stranger ever come here?" Erlang replied, "I went to Qingdi Temple early in the morning to ask you, I really don't know, I can go back and ask." Erlang went for a while and came back and said, "Indeed someone had come, and in the morning an old woman came and wanted to be a servant in my house, and my wife left her behind, still at home." The Taoist priest said, "It is this very ghost." Immediately, he went with Erlang. The Taoist priest stood in the middle of the courtyard with a wooden sword in his hand and shouted, "How dare you sinful ghost, return my fly whisk to me!" The old woman was terrified in the house and was about to go out to escape, when the Taoist priest rushed after her and knocked her down to the ground with a sword. The Taoist priest used a wooden sword to cut its head, the ghost instantly turned into smoke, hovering in a ball on the ground. The Taoist priest took out a gourd, unplugged the plug, the gourd in the smoke, in the blink of an eye, the smoke was all sucked into the gourd. The Taoist priest plugged the mouth of the gourd, the gourd put away into a bag. Everyone went to see the human skin, eyebrows, eyes, hands and feet are very complete. The Taoist priest rolled up the human skin like a scroll and put it away, about to say goodbye and leave, Chen knelt at the door, crying and begging the Taoist priest to let him save his husband. The Taoist priest excused himself and could not do anything. Chen cried more sadly, crouched on the ground and did not get up. The Taoist priest pondered for a while and said, "My magic is too shallow, I really can't bring back the dead. I will point you to a person who may be able to save your husband, and you will definitely get results if you ask him." Chen asked, "What kind of person?" The Taoist priest said, "There is a crazy man in the street who often sleeps in the dung. Go and try to beg him, and if he should go mad and insult you, you must not be angry." Erlang also knew that there was such a person. So he said goodbye to the Taoist priest, and sister-in-law together to go to the street to find.
                They saw a beggar singing on the road, snot flowing three feet long, full of filth called people who can not approach. Chen kneeling forward, the beggar smiled and asked: "Beauty loves me?" Chen's to him to explain the reason. Beggar laughed and said: "Everyone can be a husband, save his life. What is the use?" Chen insisted on pleading bitterly. The beggar said: "really strange! People died begging me to save the life, am I the king of hell?" Said, angrily hit Chen with a cane. Chen endured the pain and humiliation with tears. The street to watch the crowd gradually gathered over, in all directions around a human wall. Beggar coughing, spit and spittle got full hands, raised Chen's mouth and said: "Eat it!" Chen's face was red, but she remembered the Taoist priest's instructions, so she was forced to swallow. She only felt that the thing into the throat stems like a lump of cotton wool, grunge and down, and then depressed in the chest does not move. The beggar laughed and said: "Beauty loves me!" Said, got up and walked away, not even head back. They followed, into the temple, wanting to go to beg him again, but did not know where he was. They searched everywhere in front and behind the temple, but there was no sign of him.
                Chen's shame to return home, pity for her husband's tragic death, and recalled in the street in front of everyone swallowing the beggar's coughing spittle, really feel a great shame, hard to cry, I want to die immediately. She was about to wipe away the blood stain to collect the body into the coffin, the family stood aside to watch, no one dared to follow. Chen held the corpse to collect the intestines, while packing and crying. When her voice was hoarse, she suddenly wanted to vomit and felt the knotted mass between her chest rushing upward. She was surprised to see that it was a human heart, which had been "thumping" in her husband's chest cavity, and the heat steamed up, like smoke around. Chen was amazed and hurriedly used both hands to close her husband's chest cavity and squeezed it hard. She let go a little, the hot air came out of the seams. Then she tore off the silk cloth as a band, the husband's chest cavity tightly tied. She then touched the body with her hands and felt the warmth slowly. Then she covered the quilt again, and in the middle of the night, lifted the quilt to see that there was breathing. The next day at dawn, the husband finally came back to life. As soon as he woke up he said, "I was in a trance, like in a dream, and I only felt a vague pain in my stomach." They looked again at the place where the belly had been torn, and a scab as big as a copper coin had been formed, and soon it was completely healed.
                Ishiji said, "The world is too stupid! It was a demon, but they took it for a beautiful woman. Foolish people are confused! They take it as a delusion when it is clearly a word of advice. However, if one lusts after another's beauty and attempts to possess her, one's wife must willingly swallow the spittle of another. Heaven is good in retribution, but those who are foolish and confused do not realize it.

                Ning Caishen, a native of Zhejiang province, is generous and brisk in nature and of good character. He often said to people, "I have not touched the second woman in my life." Once, he went to Jinhua, came to a temple in the northern suburbs, unpacked and rested. The temple had a magnificent hall and pagoda, but the moss grew taller than a man, as if no one had come for a long time. The doors of the monasteries on the east and west sides were all hidden, except for a small house on the south side, the lock of which seemed to be new. Look at the eastern corner of the temple, there is a clump of thick bamboo, a large pond under the steps, the pond is full of wild lotus flowers. Ning Sheng liked the quietness of the place. At that time, it was just in time for the examination held by the school ambassador, and the price in town was expensive, so Ning Sheng wanted to live here, so he took a walk and waited for the monk to come back. When the sun was setting, a scholar came and opened the door of the south house. Ning Caishen went up and saluted, and told him he wanted to borrow the place. The scholar said: "These houses do not have owners, I also live here temporarily. If you are willing to live in this desolate place, I can also ask for advice in the morning and evening, great." Ning Caishen was very happy, get a straw on the ground as a bed, support the wooden board as a table, and intend to live here for a long time. That night, the moon was bright and clear, and the light was like water. Ning Sheng and the scholar were talking under the corridor of the hall, and they each announced their names. The scholar said, "My surname is Yan, and my name is Chixia." Ning Sheng thought he was also a scholar who had rushed to the examination, but hearing his voice did not sound like a Zhejiang native, so he asked him where he was from. The scholar said, "Shaanxi." The tone was sincere and simple. After a while, the two had nothing more to talk about, so they said goodbye and went to bed.
                Ning Sheng could not sleep for a long time because he was living in a new place. Suddenly, he heard the sound of whispering in the north of the house, as if there were family members. Ning Sheng got up and ambled under the stone window of the north wall and peeked in. There was a small courtyard outside the short wall, and there was a woman in her forties and an old mother, dressed in dark red, with silver comb-shaped jewelry on her head, hunched over and old, talking in the moonlight. I heard the woman say: "Hsiao-tsing why so long not come?" The old mother said, "Almost here!" The woman said, "Do you have a complaint against grandma?" The old mother said: "I have not heard. But she looks a little uncomfortable." The woman said, "That girl is not easy to get along with!" Before the words were finished, a woman of 17 or 18 years old came, who seemed to be very beautiful. The old mother smiled and said, "The back ground does not say people. The two of us were talking when the little goblin came quietly without saying a word, and fortunately did not say anything short about you." And said: "The little lady is really beautiful like the person on the painting, if the old body is a man, also by your soul hooked away." The woman said, "If you don't praise me, who else will say I'm good?" The woman and the woman said something else. Ning Sheng thought they were the neighbor's family, so he lay down to sleep and stopped listening. After a while, there was silence outside the courtyard.
                Ning Sheng was just about to fall asleep when he felt that someone had entered the house and hurriedly got up to check, but it was the woman from the north courtyard. Ning Sheng was surprised and asked her what she was doing. The woman said, "I can't sleep on moonlit nights and would like to share with you the pleasure of a couple." Ning Sheng said seriously, "You should beware of people talking, I am also afraid of people gossip. If you slip up a little, you will lose your morals and lose your face." The woman said, "No one knows at night." Ningsheng rebuked her again. The woman hesitated as if she still had something to say, and Ning Sheng shouted, "Go! Otherwise, I will call the scholar in the south room!" The woman was afraid, so she went away. She walked out the door and returned, putting an ingot of gold on the mattress. Ningsheng picked it up and threw it on the steps outside the court, saying, "Ill-gotten gains, dirtying my pockets!" The woman retreated in shame, picked up the gold, and said to herself, "This man is really hard-hearted!"
                The next morning a scholar from Lanxi came with his servant to prepare for the examination, and lived in the middle-east wing of the temple, when he suddenly died in the night. There was a small hole in the heart of the foot, like an awl, and blood came out in a thin stream. No one knew what was the cause. The next night, the servant also died, the same symptoms as the scholar. At night, Yansheng came back, Ning asked him about it, and Yansheng thought it was a ghost that did it. Ning Sheng is usually straightforward, did not take it to heart. In the middle of the night, the woman came again and said to Ning Sheng: "I have seen many people, but I have never seen such a straightforward heart like you. You are really sage, I dare not bully you. My name is Xiaoqian, surnamed Nie, died at the age of 18, buried next to the temple, often coerced by demons to do some lowly things, thick skin to serve others, really not what I want to do. Now there is no one to kill in the temple, I'm afraid the night fork will come to harm you! Ning Sheng was afraid and begged her to think of a way out. The woman said, "If you live with Yansheng, you will be spared." Ning Sheng asked, "Why don't you bewitch Yan Sheng?" Hsiao-tsing said, "He is a strange man, I dare not come near." Ning Sheng asked, "What method do you use to confuse people?" Hsiao-tsing said, "The person who makes out with me, I secretly stab him in the foot with an awl. When he passed out and did not know what was going on, I took his blood for the demon to drink; or lure with gold, but that is not gold, the Rakshasa ghost bones, people who leave it, will have their heart and liver cut out. Both of these methods are for people's good." Ning Sheng thanked her and asked her the date of the alert. Hsiao-tsing replied that tomorrow night. When she was parting, she said with tears in her eyes, "I am caught in the sea of suffering and cannot find the shore. The righteousness of the gentleman will be able to save the suffering and rescue. If you are willing to coffin my bones and bury them in a quiet grave, your great kindness will be like giving me life again!" Ning Sheng resolutely agreed and asked her where to be buried. Hsiao-tsing said, "Just remember, the poplar tree with the crow's nest is the place." After saying that, she walked out the door and disappeared all at once.
                The next day Ning Sheng was afraid that Yansheng would be out, so he invited him early. After the hour, he prepared food and wine, watched Yan Sheng's behavior, and asked him to sleep in a room. Yan Sheng excused himself, saying that he was a loner and loved peace and quiet. Ning Sheng refused to listen and brought his luggage over. Yan Sheng had no choice but to bring the bed over and instructed, "I know you are a great man and I admire you very much. There are some hidden feelings, it is difficult to say clearly at once. I hope you will not look through my box bag, otherwise, it will be bad for both of us!" Ning Sheng respectfully agreed. After saying that both of them lie down, Yansheng put the box on the windowsill, lay down on the pillow, not long snoring like thunder. Ning Sheng could not sleep, nearly one night, the window outside the faint shadow of a person. A moment later, the shadow near the window peeked in, eyes flashing. Ning Sheng was afraid and wanted to call out to Yansheng, but suddenly something broke through the box and flew straight out, like a dazzling white trainer, breaking the stone pane on the window, shooting abruptly and immediately returning to the box, like lightning extinguished. Yansheng was alert, Ning Sheng pretended to sleep and watched secretly. Yansheng moved through the box and took out one thing, smelling and looking at the moonlight. Ning Sheng saw that the thin white light crystal was two inches long, as wide as a leek leaf. Yansheng finished looking at it, and wrapped several layers, still in the box, and said to himself: "What old demon, have so much courage, dare to break the box!" Then he lay down again. Ning Sheng was amazed, got up and asked Yansheng, and told him what he had just seen. Yansheng said, "Since we have a deep friendship, I can't hide it anymore, I am a swordsman. If not for the stone pane on the window just now, that demon would have died then. Although he didn't die, he was also injured." Ning Sheng asked, "What is it that you are hiding?" Yansheng said, "It's a sword. I smelled it just now and it smelled like a demon." Ning Sheng wanted to take a look at it, and Yan Sheng generously took it out and showed it to him, and it turned out to be a small glittering sword. Ning Sheng was more respectful of Yan Sheng.
                After dawn, blood was found on the outside of the window. Ning Sheng went out of the temple to the north and saw a poplar tree with a crow's nest in the middle of a deserted grave. When the arrangements for moving the graves were done, Ning Sheng packed his bags and prepared to go back. Yansheng gave him a farewell, the friendship is deep. He also gave a broken leather bag to Ning Sheng, saying, "This is a sword bag, treasure it well, it can avoid evil and drive away ghosts." Ning Sheng wanted to learn the art of swordsmanship from him, but Yan Sheng said, "A man of faith and integrity like you can be a swordsman; but you are a rich man, not a man of this path." Ning Sheng pretended to have a sister buried here, exhumed the woman's bones, collected them, wrapped them in clothes and blankets, and rented a boat to go home. In Ning Sheng's study against the wilderness, he created a grave there, and buried Xiao Qian outside the study. He prayed when he paid his respects: "Pity you are a lonely soul, and bury you by the study, so that you can hear each other's songs and cries, and no longer be bullied by the male ghosts. Please drink a cup of pulpy water, which is not considered clean and sweet, and may you not dislike it." When he had finished praying, he was going back. At that moment someone called out to him from behind: "Please slow down, wait for me to go with you!" Ning Sheng turned around and saw that it was Hsiao-tsing. Hsiao-tsing thanked him joyfully and said, "If you are so faithful, I can't repay you even if I die ten times! Please let me go back with you to meet my in-laws, and I don't regret to be your concubine." Ning Sheng looked at her carefully, white and red skin, like a pair of thin bamboo shoots feet, daytime, more beautiful and delicate. So, Ning Sheng came to the study with her, and asked her to sit and wait for a while, and he went in to report to his mother. The mother was shocked to hear this. At this time, Ning Sheng's wife had been sick for a long time, the mother warned him not to leak, for fear of scaring his wife. Just finished, Hsiao-tsing has lightly walked in and kneeled on the ground. Ning Sheng said, "This is Hsiao-tsing." The mother looked at her in horror, not knowing what to do. Hsiao-tsing said to her mother, "My daughter has drifted away from my parents and brothers, and I have been taken care of by the grandson with profound grace. I am willing to be a concubine to repay your kindness." The mother saw her gentle and beautiful, very lovely, then she dared to speak with her and said, "I like it very much that you think highly of my son. But I have only one son in my life, still expecting him to pass on the family line, dare not let him marry a ghost daughter-in-law." Xiao Qian said, "My daughter does not have second thoughts, I am a person under the nine springs, since I can not get the trust of my mother, please let me serve the gongzi as an elder brother. How about following the old mother and serving you morning and evening?" The mother took pity on her sincerity and agreed. Hsiao-tsing then wanted to pay a visit to her sister-in-law, the mother excused her illness, Hsiao-tsing did not go; and immediately went into the kitchen, instead of the mother to take care of food, out and in, as if long lived familiar with the same.
                It was dark, mother was afraid of her, let her go back to sleep, not to her bed mattress. Xiaoxian knew her mother's intention, so she left immediately. Passing by Ning Sheng's study, I wanted to go in, and then backed out, hovering outside the door, as if afraid of something. Ning Sheng called her, Xiaoxian said, "The house sword Qi is scary, did not see you on the road before, that is the reason." Ning Sheng understood that it was the skin bag, so he took it and hung it in another room, before Xiao Qian went in. She sat down near the candlelight, sat for a while, did not say a word. After a long time, Hsiao-tsing asked, "Do you read at night? When I was a child, I read the Lanyan Sutra, but now I have forgotten most of it. I beg you to give me a volume, there is nothing to do at night, please correct my brother." Ning Sheng agreed. Xiaoxian sat for a while, but still did not speak; the second night was almost over, and did not say go. Ning Sheng urged her, Xiao Qian said miserably: "I am a lonely soul from abroad, especially afraid of the deserted tomb." Ning Sheng said, "There is no other bed to sleep in the study, and we are brother and sister, we should also avoid suspicion." Xiao Qian got up, sad face like to cry out, hesitant footsteps, slowly out of the room, stepped over the steps and disappeared. Ning Sheng secretly pity her, wanting to keep her in another bed to stay, but afraid of mother reproach. Xiaoxian came to greet her mother early in the morning, holding a basin to serve washing. The housekeeping work is not not to her liking. At dusk, she retired and often went to the study to read the scriptures by candlelight. When she found that Ning Sheng wanted to sleep, she was left in misery.
                Earlier, Ningsheng's wife was sick, unable to do housework, mother was tired and exhausted. Since Hsiao-tsing came, the mother was very restful and grateful. Treat her more and more affectionately day by day, just like their own daughter, even forget that she is a ghost, can not bear to drive her away again at night, so stay with her to sleep and get up. Xiao Qian just came, never eating, drinking water, half a year later, gradually drinking some thin rice soup. Ning Sheng and mother are very doting on her, avoiding saying she is a ghost, others do not know. Not long after, Ning Sheng's wife died. Mother privately has the intention of marrying Xiaoqian as a daughter-in-law, but is also afraid that the son is not good. Xiaoxian more or less knows the mother's mind, so take the opportunity to tell her mother: "In here for more than a year, the mother should know the heart of the son. I came here with Mr. Lang in order not to harm the pedestrians. I don't mean anything else, but I just want to rely on him to help me for a few years, so that I can win the emperor's seal and feel honored in the next life." The mother also knew that she did not have malicious intent, just afraid that she could not have children. Xiao Qian said: "Children are given by heaven. You are destined to be blessed with three sons, and you will not have any children because you are a ghost wife." The mother believed her, and conferred with her son. Ning Sheng was so happy that he set up a banquet and told his relatives and friends. Some people asked to meet the new daughter-in-law, and Hsiao-tsing, dressed in beautiful clothes, came out frankly to pay her respects. The room full of people looked at her in amazement, not only did not suspect that she was a ghost, but suspected that she was a fairy. So the relatives within the five suits of Ning Sheng, all bring gifts to congratulate Xiao Qian, and compete with her. Hsiao-tsing was good at painting orchids and plum blossoms, and always paid her with paintings. All the people who got her paintings treasured the paintings and felt honored.
                One day, Hsiao-tsing leaned down in front of the window, depressed, like a lost soul. She suddenly asked, "Where is the skin?" Ning Sheng said, "Because you are afraid of it, so put it in another room." Hsiao-tsing said, "I've been receiving the breath of the living for a long time, and I'm not afraid anymore. It should be brought to hang over the bed!" Ning Sheng asked her what happened, Hsiao-tsing said, "For three days, I was afraid and uneasy in my heart. I think it is the demon creature of Jinhua, hate me for hiding far away, afraid that sooner or later I will find it here." Ning Sheng then brought the skin bag, Hsiao-tsing looked at it repeatedly and said, "This is used by the Sword Fairy to load human heads. Worn to this extent, I wonder how many people have been killed! I still have goose bumps when I see it today." After saying that, he hung the sword bag on the bed. The next day, Hsiao-tsing again let it hang on the door. At night sitting against the candle, Ning Sheng also told him not to sleep. Suddenly, something fell down like a flying bird, Xiao Qian panicked and hid in the curtain. The Ning Sheng look, this thing is shaped like a nightstick, electric eyes and bloody tongue, two claws scratching and reaching over. To the door and stop, hovering for a long time, gradually approaching the skin bag, picking with claws, as if to scratch it crack. Suddenly the bag inside a ring, became as big as two bamboo baskets, a ghost in a trance, protruding half of the body, the night fork a grab into, then silent, the bag also suddenly shrunk back to its original size. Ning Sheng was both scared and surprised. Hsiao-tsing came out and said with great joy, "It's okay!" They looked into the bag together and saw that there were only a few buckets of water.
                A few years later, Ning Sheng did get a scholarship and Hsiao-tsing gave birth to a boy. Ning Sheng took another concubine, and they each had a boy. All three children later became officials, and the official reputation is very good.

                There were several merchants living together in a house in the capital. The house was connected to the neighboring house by a plank wall; there was a pine joint on the plank that had fallen off, and the cave was the size of a cup. Suddenly a woman stuck her head out of the cave, with a beautiful phoenix bun, and then she stretched out an arm, white as jade. The crowd was afraid that she was a demon and tried to catch her, but she had shrunk back. A moment later, the beauty of the head again revealed, the merchants ran to the next door to find that there was no body of her. By the time people ran over again, the beauty head retracted again.
                One of the merchants hid under the wall with a knife. In a moment, the head of the beauty again extended, the merchant suddenly with a knife to cut. The beauty's head fell with the knife and blood was splashed all over the ground. The merchants were alarmed and told their master. The owner was afraid and took the head of the beauty to the official. The government arrested the merchants and interrogated them, thinking it was ridiculous. They were detained for half a year, but no confessions were obtained to match the facts of the crime, and no one came to sue for human life, so the merchants were released and the head was buried.

                There is a showman named Li Zhongzhi in Laiwu, Shandong Province, who has an upright and honest character and does not follow personal feelings. Every few days, he would die, his body stiffened like a corpse, only to wake up three or four days later. He was asked what he had seen, and he kept it a secret. A fellow villager, Zhang Sheng, also died once every few days. (Zhang Sheng) said to people, "Li Zhongzhi is Yan Luo. I am a clerk under him in the Underworld." Even the couplets of the main gate and the main hall of Yan Luo's residence, this Zhang Sheng could recount them in detail.
                Someone asked, "What was the business of Li Zhongzhi's visit to the Underworld yesterday?" Zhang Sheng said, "I can't tell you in detail. I only know that he arranged Cao Cao and beat him with twenty lashes."
                Pu Songling said, "The case of Cao Cao has been heard by dozens of Yan Luo, I think. Punishment of his reincarnation as an animal or barefoot crawling on the sword mountain and other punishments should be guilty, right, Cao Cao's sin is obvious, the sentence is not difficult; but thousands of years have passed without a verdict, what is the reason? Is it because criminals sentenced to death, to die quickly as soon as possible, so as not to suffer sporadically, so that Cao Cao in the netherworld delayed the verdict, so that he could not die? It's too strange!"

                Nie Pengyun, a Tai'an man, was very close to his wife. After his wife died of a disease, he was sad all day long and lost his soul.
                One night, he was sitting in the house, when his wife suddenly pushed the door and came in. He was surprised and asked, "Why are you here?" She smiled and said, "I have become a ghost, and was moved by your deep mourning, and begged the permission of the director of the underworld to come and meet you for a while." Nie was so happy that he took his wife to bed and felt no different from her when she was alive. From then on, day and night, for more than a year, Nie did not mention taking another wife. The brothers in the clan were afraid that he would be cut off, so they privately advised him to marry again. Nie obeyed, hired a good woman. But he was afraid that the ghost wife was not happy, keep it a secret. Soon, when the wedding day came, the ghost wife found out about it and scolded him, saying, "I risked being punished in the underworld to meet you because of your love for your husband and wife; who knows you won't keep your promise, is that how deep love is?" Nie said this is the clan's meaning. The ghost wife was always unhappy and left without making out with him. Nie felt sorry for him, but the realization of the intention to marry again, but also feel relieved.
                On the wedding night, after the couple went to bed, the ghost wife suddenly came and slapped the new daughter-in-law from the bed and cursed, "How dare you take my bed!" The new daughter-in-law got up and fought with her. Nie was so scared that she crouched naked on the bed, not daring to protect one. A while later, the rooster crowed at dawn and the ghosts went away.
                The new daughter-in-law suspected that Nie's wife was not dead and blamed her husband for lying to her and wanted to hang herself. Nie told her the reason, the new daughter-in-law believed it was a ghost. When the ghost came in the dark, the new daughter-in-law was so scared that she hid; the ghost stopped sleeping with Nie and only pinched his flesh with her nails, and then glared at him with angry eyes at the candle, but did not say anything. Nie was so worried. Someone in the neighboring village will exorcise the ghosts, cutting peach wood pegs wedged in the four corners of her grave, before the ghosts are no longer haunted.

                There is a doctor surnamed Yang in Shanxi, good at acupuncture, but also can ask the ghosts to work for him. Once outside, those leading mules, holding the whip are some ghosts.
                One night, Dr. Yang returned home from abroad, and made friends along the way. On the way, he saw two people walking towards him, tall and big, very different from normal people. The friend was shocked, and Dr. Yang went forward and asked, "What are you people?" The answer was, "Long-legged King and Big Head Li have come to greet the master." Dr. Yang said, "Lead the way ahead for me." The two men turned and flew forward, and when they saw that Mr. Yang had fallen behind, they stood still and waited for him, as if they were slaves.

                During the Xuande period of the Ming Dynasty, the imperial family loved the game of cricket and collected crickets from the people every year. They were not originally produced in Shaanxi. A county official in Huayin County wanted to curry favor with his superiors and offered a cricket to them. The superiors tried to make it fight and showed their brave and good fighting skills, so they ordered him to supply it regularly. The magistrate also assigned the task of supplying to the lizheng of each township. So the idle young men in the market, when they caught a good cricket, fed it in a bamboo cage and raised its price; they stored it up and waited for it to be sold at a high price as if it were a rare commodity. The countryside officials were cunning and tricky, and took the opportunity to assess fees on the people, often bankrupting several families for each cricket.
                There was a man named Cheng Ming in the county who was a scholar and had not been a successful candidate for a long time. He was a restrained person, not good at talking, so he was reported to the county by a tricky and deceitful official and asked to take up the post of lizheng, but he tried every possible way to get rid of the post of lizheng. In less than a year, his meager family fortune was lost. When the crickets were collected, Naruto did not dare to extort the people, but he did not have the money to pay for it, so he was so sad and miserable that he wanted to die. His wife said, "What good would it do to die? Why don't you go looking for one yourself and hope that there is a one in a million chance of catching one?" Naruto thought these words were right. So he went out early and came back late, carrying a bamboo silk cage, at the foot of the broken wall. In the barren grass, digging rocks, digging large holes, all kinds of methods have been exhausted, but ultimately unsuccessful. Even if they caught two or three, they were weak and small, and the style did not match. The magistrate set a strict deadline and pressed the matter, and Cheng Ming was beaten with hundreds of boards in ten days, and his legs were dripping with pus and blood.
                At that time, a hunchbacked witch came to the village, who could predict bad luck through ghosts and gods. The famous wife prepared a gift of money and went to ask the gods. She saw red-faced maidens and white-haired old women crowding the doorway. When she entered the witch's house, she saw a dark room with a curtain and an incense burner outside the curtain. Those who asked for gods put incense on the censer and worshiped twice. The witch was looking at the air and praying for them, her lips were closing and closing, not knowing what she was saying. Everyone stood in reverence and listened. After a while, a slip of paper was thrown out of the room, and on it was written what was on the mind of the person asking for God, without any mistake. The wife of the deity put the money on the case and burned incense and prostrated like the people before her. After a meal, the curtain moved and a piece of paper was thrown down. When she picked it up, she saw that it was not an inscription, but a picture, in which a pavilion was painted, like a temple; behind the pavilion, at the foot of the mountain, there were some strange-shaped stones, with a thicket of thorns, and a green hemp-headed cricket was lying there; next to it was a toad, as if it were about to jump up. She unfolded it and looked at it for a while, not understanding what it meant. But when she saw the cricket painted on it, it was exactly what she had in mind, so she folded the piece of paper and put it together, and gave it to Cheng Ming to read when she got home.
                The first time I saw the picture, I thought, "I think it means the place where I catch crickets. The picture is very similar to the Big Buddha Pavilion in the east of the village. So he got up in pain, held his staff, took the diagram to the back of the temple, and saw an ancient tomb rising high up. Cheng Ming ran forward along the ancient tomb, only to see a piece of stone, as if arranged like fish scales, really like in the painting. He then walked slowly through the weeds with one side listening to the other side, as if looking for a needle and a small plant; however, his mind, eyesight, and hearing were all exhausted, but there was no sign of crickets at all. He was exploring with all his heart when suddenly a toad jumped over. Cheng Ming, more amazed, rushed to chase it, and the toad jumped into the grass. He then followed the toad's trail, separated from the grass to look, only to see a cricket lying under the root of the spine, he rushed to catch it, the cricket jumped into the stone hole. He ruffled with fine grass, the cricket did not come out; and then used a bamboo tube to get water into the stone hole, the cricket came out, the shape is extremely handsome and robust. He then chased after it and caught it. When he took a closer look, he saw that the cricket was large, with a long tail, a green neck and golden wings. He was so happy that he took it home in a cage and celebrated with his whole family, treating it as more precious than the precious jade, putting it in a pot and feeding it with crab meat and chestnut powder.
                Cheng Ming had a son, nine years old, saw that his father was not at home, and secretly opened the basin to see. The crickets jumped out at once, too fast to catch. When he caught it, the cricket's legs had fallen off and its stomach was broken, and it died in a few moments. The child, frightened, cried and told his mother, who, hearing this, turned ashen with fright and exclaimed, "Bane, your time of death has come! When your father comes back, he will naturally settle the score with you!" The child cried and ran away.
                Not long after, Cheng Ming came back, and after hearing his wife's words, his whole body seemed to be covered with ice and snow. Angry, he went to look for his son, who was nowhere to be found. He soon found his body in the well, so his anger immediately turned into grief, and he cried out to heaven and earth in grief. The husband and wife were crying in tears against the wall, there was no smoke in the hut, and they sat face to face without saying a word, and no longer had anything to rely on. It was only in the evening that they took the straw mat and prepared to bury the child. The couple approached to touch, there was a faint breath. They happily put him to bed, and the child woke up again in the middle of the night. The couple was a little relieved, but the child looked dull, his breath was weak, and he just wanted to sleep. When Cheng Ming looked back and saw the cricket cage empty, he was so sad that he couldn't breathe or speak, and he didn't care about his son anymore. The sun had risen in the east, and he was still lying straight in bed, worrying. Suddenly he heard the chirping of a cricket outside the door, and when he got up in surprise to take a closer look, the cricket seemed to be still there. He was happy to catch it, but the cricket chirped and jumped away, jumping very fast. He used his palm to cover it, but his palm was empty as if there was nothing there; just as he raised his hand, it jumped away again. Cheng Ming hurried to chase it, turned the corner, and did not know where it went. He looked around and saw the cricket lying on the wall. He looked at it carefully, it was short and black and red, and immediately felt that it was not like the previous one. He was not able to see it because of its small size. He kept looking back and forth, looking for the one he was chasing. This is when the small cricket on the wall suddenly jumped into his sleeve. It was shaped like a mole cricket, with plum wings, a square head and long legs, and a good variety of weaving from the look of it. He was happy to adopt it, ready to offer it to the government, but his heart is still very unsure, afraid that it does not fit the county officials. He wanted to try to let it fight first, to see how it would be.
                A young man in the village, who liked to be nosy, kept a cricket and named it "Crab Shell Green", and he never failed to win a cricket fight with other teenagers every day. He wanted to keep it as a curiosity for profiteering, so he raised the price, but no one bought it. One day the boy came straight to Cheng Ming and when he saw the cricket he had, he just covered his mouth and laughed, then took out his own cricket and put it into the cage he had put it in. When he saw that the cricket was long and big, he was ashamed of himself and did not dare to take his own small cricket to compete with the boy's "crab shell green". The young man insisted on fighting, but Sung Ming thought he had no use for such a lowly thing after all, so he might as well let it fight for a laugh. So he put the two crickets in the same bucket. The little cricket was lying still, frozen like a wooden chicken, and the teenager laughed again. Then he tried to tease the cricket's tentacles with his piggyback hair, but the cricket still did not move, and the teenager laughed again. After teasing it several times, the famous cricket suddenly became furious and rushed forward, so they fought with each other, pouncing on each other, raising their feet, and chirping their wings. The cricket jumped up, opened its tail, raised its whiskers, and bit the neck of the other. The young man was shocked and hurriedly separated them to stop fighting. The cricket raised its head and raised its wings and chirped proudly, as if to report its master's success. The two of them were watching, when suddenly a chicken came and pecked at the cricket. The two of them were watching, and suddenly a chicken came and pecked at the little cricket, which was more than a foot away. The chicken was strong and powerful, and forced past with great strides, and the cricket was crushed under the chicken's claws. The company's main goal was to get the best out of the market. Suddenly, I saw the chicken stretching its neck and twisting its head, and when I looked closely, the little cricket was squatting on the chicken's crown and stinging hard. The more surprised he was, the more he caught it and put it in his cage.
                The next day, Cheng Ming presented the cricket to the magistrate, who saw that it was small and angrily rebuked Cheng Ming. The magistrate didn't believe him when he told him about the cricket's peculiar abilities. He tried to fight with other crickets, but all of them were defeated. Then he tried to fight with a chicken, and it was just as Cheng Ming had said. So he rewarded Cheng Ming and presented the crickets to the governor. The governor liked it so much that he presented it to the emperor in a gold cage and wrote a memo stating in detail what it could do. After arriving at the palace, all the butterflies, praying mantis, greasy tart, green silk forehead and various rare crickets contributed by the whole country fought with the little cricket, none of which could take advantage of it. Whenever it hears the sound of the piano and the cassette, it can dance to the beat, and everyone feels more and more surprised. The emperor liked it even more, so he issued an edict to reward the governor with good horses and brocade. The governor did not forget where the benefits came from, and soon the magistrate was also known for his outstanding talent. As soon as the magistrate was pleased, he exempted Cheng Ming from the service and instructed the examiner to let Cheng Ming win the talent. After a year or so, Cheng Ming's son recovered mentally. He said he became a cricketer, light and good at fighting. Only then did he wake up. The governor also rewarded Narimyo. Within a few years, he had more than a hundred hectares of land, many high buildings and pavilions, and hundreds of cattle and sheep; whenever he went out, he wore light fur and rode on a high horse, and was even more generous than those who had been officials for generations.
                Ishi said: "The emperor occasionally used a thing, not necessarily not used it and then forgot; however, the people below implemented it as a set practice. Together with the officials' greed and tyranny, the common people mortgaged their wives and sold their children all year round, and still there was no end to it. So the emperor's every move, is related to the people's lives, can not be ignored ah! Only Cheng Ming, a man who was poor because of the official's aggression and rich because of the tribute of crickets, wore expensive leather clothes, rode in a luxurious carriage and horse, and was proud of himself. When he became a lord of the village and was chastised, he never thought he would be in this situation! God wants to reward those who are honest and loyal with this, even the governor and county officials have been benefited by the cricket. I've heard that 'when a man becomes immortal, even chickens and dogs can go to heaven. This is really true!"

                There was a man in the eastern county who made his living by playing with snakes. He once tamed two snakes, both green in color, and called the big one Big Green and the little one Two Green. The second green had a red dot on its forehead and was particularly clever and tame, commanding it to hover and perform without fail. Therefore, the snake people love it more than the other snakes.
                After a year, the big green died, and the snake man wanted to find another one to fill the gap, but never bothered to do so. One night, he boarded at a monastery in the mountains. At dawn, he opened the bamboo box and saw that the second green was also gone. The snake man was so frustrated that he searched and called in the dark and in the light, but never saw a shadow. Previously, whenever he went to a place where grass and trees were abundant, he would let the snakes out and let them go free, and soon he would return. For this reason, the snake man still hoped that it would come back by itself, so he sat and waited. It was not until the sun rose very high and he himself was desperate that he left in disgust.
                Just a few steps out the door, the snake man suddenly heard a rustling sound from the overgrown grass. He stopped in his tracks and looked in amazement, it was Erqing who had returned. The snake man was very happy, as if he had won a priceless treasure. Putting the burden on the roadside, Erqing also stopped. Then he looked behind it, followed by a small snake. He stroked Erqing and said, "I thought you had run away. Did you recommend that little guy?" Saying so, he took out the feed to feed it, and also gave some to the little snake. The little snake did not leave, but cowered there and did not dare to come and eat. Erqing fed it with the feed in his mouth, as if the host was entertaining a guest. The snake man fed it again before it ate. After eating, the snake followed Erqing piece into the bamboo box.
                The snake man picked it back and trained it, and the little snake coiled and bent to meet the requirements, not much different from Erqing. So he named it Xiaoqing. The snake man took them both, four-way performance of the show, earned a lot of money.
                General snake charmer juggling snake, not more than two feet, then too heavy, you have to replace it. Because the two greens are very tame, the snake man did not immediately replace it. After two or three years, the two greens had grown to more than three feet long, lying in the bamboo box, the bamboo box was stuffed to the brim, so the snake man decided to let it go.
                One day, the snake man came to the east mountains of Zichuan County, took out the best food to feed Erqing, blessed it and then released it. Erqing went away, but returned a while later, crawling around the bamboo box. The snake man waved his hand to drive it away and said, "Go away! There is no banquet in the world that does not end in a hundred years. From now on, you are hidden in the deep mountains and valleys, and you will definitely be able to train as a divine dragon in the future. How can you live in a bamboo box for a long time?" Only then did Erqing leave, and the snake man watched it leave. But a little while later, Erqing came back, the snake man how to drive it does not go, but also with the head touching the bamboo box, the small green in the bamboo box also kept scurrying. The snake man suddenly realized: "Do you want to say goodbye to Xiaoqing?" Then he opened the bamboo box. Little green from the bamboo box straight out, two green and it crossed the head and tongue, as if to instruct each other words. Then the two snakes snuggled together and went away. The snake man was thinking that Xiaoqing would not come back, but a while later Xiaoqing came back alone and crawled into the bamboo box to lie down.
                From then on, the snake man was always looking for a new snake, but there was no suitable one. The little green also grew up and was not easy to perform. Later, the snake man got a snake, which was also very tame, but in the end it was not as good as Xiaoqing. By this time, Xiaoqing had grown thicker than a child's arm.
                Earlier, Erqing was often seen in the mountains by firewood hunters. After a few years, the green grew to several feet long and as thick as a bowl, and gradually came out to chase people. Therefore, pedestrians and travelers are cautioning each other, do not dare to go from the road it infested. One day, the snake man passed there, a snake sprang up, line like a sudden wind. The snake was terrified and ran desperately. The snake chased more quickly. He looked back and saw a red dot on the snake's head, and realized that it was Erqing. He put down his burden and shouted, "Erqing, Erqing!" The snake stopped at once, raised its head for a long time, and came up to wrap the snake man, just like the previous performance. The snake man sensed that the two greens did not mean to harm him, but only because the body was too heavy, he could not withstand its winding. Only fell to the ground and prayed loudly, so Erqing let go of him. Erqing used his head to touch the bamboo box again. The snake man understood its meaning and opened the bamboo box to release Xiaoqing. As soon as the two snakes met, they immediately intertwined tightly and stuck together like caramel for a long time before separating. The snake man blessed Xiaoqing and said, "I have long wanted to part with you, but today you have company." And also said to Erqing: "Xiaoqing was originally attracted to you, you can still lead it away. I will give you another word of advice, there is no shortage of food and drink for you in the deep mountains, do not disturb the passers-by, lest you suffer the punishment of heaven." Two snakes are hanging their heads, as if accepting his advice, immediately scampering up and left, two green in front, small green in the back, where they passed, the trees and grass are separated from it, to the two sides of the fall. The snake man stood there for a long time looking at, until out of sight before leaving. Since then, the pedestrians passed through that area as safe as before, I do not know where the two snakes went.
                The Isoshi said: Snakes, a clumsy and slow creature, are still fond of their old friends, and they listen to advice as easily as round things. The only strange thing is that those who are human, for those who have more than ten years of deep friendship, for those who have been gracious to you for decades (or generations), easily want to fall on the well. There are also those who not only ignore your advice, but also treat him as an enemy. If these two snakes heard about this, I'm afraid they would be ashamed of themselves!

                At the end of the Ming Dynasty, there were many robbers in various areas under the Jinan Prefecture, and every county had an army to kill robbers when they were caught. There were especially many bandits in Zhangqiu County. In this county, there was a soldier in the army who wore a particularly sharp knife and did not have to make any effort to kill them. One day, the army captured a dozen robbers and took them all to the court to be beheaded. One of the bandits recognized the soldier and hesitantly approached him, saying, "I heard that your sword is the fastest and you don't have to cut off the head twice. Please kill me!" The soldier said, "All right. Stay with me and don't leave me." The bandit followed the soldier to the execution ground, and the soldier chopped his head off with a slash, and the bandit's head fell off with a bang and rolled several paces away, spinning on the ground while praising loudly, "What a fast knife!"

                Zi Xun added: "There was a man who sold his art in the market of Chang'an Street and performed a rat show. He carried a pocket on his back, which contained more than ten small mice. Whenever he arrived at a crowded place, he took out a small wooden frame and put it on his shoulder, much like a theater building. Then beat the drum board, singing the ancient miscellaneous drama. The song just exit, there are mice out of the pocket, masked with false masks, draped with a small theater makeup, from the back of the sellers to mount the theater building, standing and dancing like a human being. And the performance of male and female sadness and joy, and the sellers sing the plot of the play exactly match."

                A certain man in Lu'an Prefecture, whose father was detained in prison for some reason, was dying. He searched all the money in his house and gathered a hundred taels of silver, which he intended to use to ask for a favor in the county capital. When he went out on his mule, the little black dog he had at home followed him. A certain A scolded and drove it away, so that it retreated. After he left, the dog followed him again, and did not go back even after being driven with a whip. A mule halfway down the road, to the side of the road for convenience, after the convenience, with a stone thrown to smash the dog, the dog ran away. When the dog was walking forward again, the dog caught up with him and bit the mule's tail and hooves. The dog kept whimpering. Suddenly jumped in front of the mule's head and bit it, seemingly trying to block his way. A certain A thinks this thing is unlucky, it is more angry, riding the mule turned around to chase to drive it. When the dog ran away, he turned the mule's head and ran fast, coming to the county when it was nearly evening. When he pressed the money pouch at his waist, he lost half of his silver, sweat flowed down, and his soul was scared out of him. He tossed and turned, unable to sleep, and suddenly remembered that the dog must have a reason for barking. He got up early and waited at the city gate to open the gate to come out of the city, looking carefully at the road he came through. He thought, this is the north-south road, pedestrians like ants, lost silver which has the reason to still be there. He hesitantly came to the place where he came to get off the mule, and saw the dog already dead in the grass. The sweat on his body had soaked through his fur, as if he had just been washed. Lift the dog's ear to see that into the seal of silver neatly laid out there. The person was moved by the dog's righteousness, and bought a coffin to bury it. People call that grave "righteous dog mound.

                A butcher went home after selling meat, and it was already late. At that moment, a wolf suddenly appeared. The wolf kept peering at the meat the butcher was carrying, and the saliva in his mouth seemed to be about to flow out, and thus trailed the butcher for several miles. The butcher felt frightened, so he took the butcher's knife and gestured to the wolf. The wolf retreated a little, but when the butcher turned around and continued to walk forward, the wolf followed him again. The butcher had no choice, so he thought that the wolf wanted the meat, so he should hang it on the tree (so that the wolf could not reach it) and come back to get it in the morning (when the wolf had gone). So the butcher hung the meat on the hook, stood on his tiptoes (the hook with the meat) and hung it on the tree, and then showed the empty stretcher to the wolf. With this the wolf stopped and no longer followed the butcher. The butcher then went home (safely). The next day at dawn, the butcher went to the place where the meat had been hung yesterday to get the meat, but from afar he saw a huge thing hanging on the tree, just like a man hanging from the tree, and felt very afraid. (The butcher was afraid) carefully (around the tree) wandered closer to the tree, and when he came close to see, it turned out that (the tree hanging) was a dead wolf. (The butcher) looked up and found that the wolf had meat in its mouth, and the hook hanging from it had pierced the upper jaw of the wolf, as if a fish had bitten the bait. At that time, the wolf skin was very expensive in the market, and it was worth more than ten taels of silver, so the butcher's life was slightly better.
                Just like climbing up a tree to catch a fish, the wolf wanted to eat meat, but ended up in a scourge, which is ridiculous!

                After the failure of Yu Qi, the people implicated in this case were killed, with Laiyang and Qixia counties being the most numerous. Sometimes, hundreds of people were searched and arrested every day, and all were killed on the performance field. The blood was all over the ground and the bones were scattered. Some officials showed mercy and donated a sum of money to buy coffins for those killed. As a result, all the coffins in the coffin stores in the provincial capital were bought out. Most of those killed were buried in the southern suburbs of the city.
                In the thirteenth year of Kangxi, a scholar from Laiyang came to Jinan. His friends and relatives, two or three people were also killed here. He bought some paper and incense offerings and so on, came to the southern suburbs of the city among the tired barren graves, to pay tribute to the souls of those who died. In the evening, he stayed in a monastery next to the barren graves. Rent a house to stay.
                The next day, Lai Yang Sheng went to the city because of something, and did not come back very late in the day. Suddenly, a young man visited the house and saw that Lai Yang Sheng was not in his apartment, so he took off his hat and did not take off his shoes and lay on his back. The servant asked him who he was, but the boy did not answer even with his eyes closed. When Leyang Sheng returned to the temple, it was already very late, and the night was so misty that nothing could be distinguished. He personally went to the bedside to ask, and the boy stared straight at me and said, "I'm waiting for your master, and you're rambling on and on about what? Am I a thief?" Lai Yang Sheng said with a smile, "The master is right here." Hearing this, the young man hastily got up, put on his hat and adjusted his clothes, bowed to Lai Yang Sheng and sat down to exchange pleasantries with him. Hearing his accent, he seemed to have known each other before. He shouted to the servant to bring the lamp, and saw that it was his friend Zhu Sheng, who was also killed in the Yu Qi Yi case. Laiyang Sheng was shocked, could not help but backward, turned around to leave. Zhu Sheng pulled him forward and said: "I have a textual friendship with you, how can you be so heartless? Although I have become a ghost, but the love of friends, still remember. Now I have offended you, I hope you will not think I am a ghost and suspect." Lai Yang Sheng sat down and asked him what he had to say. Zhu Sheng said, "Your niece lives alone and has not married yet. I would like to find a wife, I have asked several times to propose, but she has always refused because there is no elder to make the decision. I hope I can get your help to make this happen."
                As it turns out, Lai Yang Sheng did have a niece who lost her mother when she was young and was placed in a foster home. She returned to her father when she was fifteen years old, and was later arrested by the government soldiers and sent to Jinan. When she heard the news of her father's tragic death, she was shocked and mourned, and died soon after.
                When Lai Yang Sheng heard Zhu Sheng's plea, he said, "She has her own father as her master, why beg me?" Zhu Sheng said, "Her father's casket was moved by her nephew and is no longer here." Lai Yang Sheng asked again, "Who did she rely on in the past?" Zhu Sheng said, "She lived with an old lady from the neighborhood." Leyang Sheng thought privately, "How can a living person play matchmaker for a ghost? Zhu Sheng said, "If you agree, you have to go." After saying that, he stood up and took Lai Yang Sheng's hand. Lai Yang Sheng firmly refused and said, "Where to go?" Zhu Sheng said, "You can come with me." Lai Yangsheng had to reluctantly go with him.
                About a mile to the north, there is a large village, the village has about a few hundred families. When he came to the house, Zhu Sheng stopped and knocked on the door. Immediately, an old lady came out, opened both doors and asked Zhu Sheng what he wanted. Zhu Sheng said, "Please tell the girl that her uncle is here." The old lady went in and came back out in a moment, invited Lai Yang Sheng to go in, turned back to Zhu Sheng and said, "The two rooms are too narrow, please wait outside the door for a moment." Lai Yang Sheng followed the old lady inside and saw two huts in the half-acre deserted courtyard. The niece welcomed at the door and cried, Lai Yang Sheng also cried.
                Into the house, the light was faint. I saw my niece looking beautiful, white as when she was born. She looked at her uncle with tears in her eyes and asked how her aunt and uncle were doing at home. Lai Yang Sheng said, "Everyone is fine, but your aunt has passed away." Hearing this, the niece cried again and said, "I was raised by my uncle and aunt since I was a child, and I have not been able to repay any of their kindnesses, but I never thought I would be buried in a ditch first. Last year, my elder brother moved my father away and abandoned me here without a care. I was alone in this foreign land hundreds of miles away, lonely and miserable, like a swallow in late autumn. My uncle did not abandon me as a lonely soul, and gave me money and gifts, which I received." Lai Yang Sheng told her about Zhu Sheng's marriage proposal, and her niece just bowed her head and didn't say anything. The old lady said: "Mr. Zhu had asked Mrs. Yang to come three or five times before, I also think this is a good marriage, but the girl herself always refused to sloppily agree to it. Today, I am satisfied with my uncle's decision.
                While talking, a girl of 17 or 18 years old pushed in the door, followed by a maid. The girl glanced at Lai Yang Sheng and turned to leave, but her niece took her by the lapel and said, "Don't be like that, it's my uncle, not an outsider." Layangsheng bowed, and the girl returned the gesture by straightening her clothes. The niece introduced: "Her name is Jiu Niang, surnamed Gongsun, Qixia County people. Her father was also the son of a family, but later failed, and now has become so poor and sad. Alone, everything is not satisfactory. The two of us are very good friends, often in correspondence." While talking, Lai Yang Sheng peeked at Jiu Niang, only to see her smile when the two eyebrows like a new moon in autumn a hook; shy, cheeks like a blush of the sunset, is really a heavenly immortal. Lai Yang Sheng said: "I can see that she is a lady of the house! How can a girl from a small family have such grace and elegance?" My niece said, "She is a female bachelor with high poetic attainments and gave me some advice yesterday." Jiu Niang smiled and said, "Little girl, you are ruining someone's reputation for no reason, so that Uncle can hear the joke." The niece smiled again and said, "My aunt has died, and my uncle has not yet married again. Jiuniang ran out laughing and said, "This girl has committed madness." Although this was said in jest, Lai Yang Sheng had a good feeling for Jiuniang in his heart. The niece seemed to have sensed it, and said, "Jiu Niang's talent is unparalleled in the world, and if uncle does not make it a taboo for her to be a ghost underground, I will talk to her mother." Lai Yang Sheng was very happy, but his heart was always suspicious of human ghosts difficult to marry. The niece explained, "It's not bad, uncle and Jiu Niang are destined to be together." When Lai Yang Sheng said goodbye, his niece said, "Five days later, when the moon is bright and quiet, I will send someone to pick you up."
                After Lai Yang Sheng went out, he did not see Zhu Sheng. Looking around, the half-round moon hung in the western sky, and in the dim moonlight, he could still make out the way he had come. He saw a mansion facing south, and Zhu Sheng was sitting on the steps waiting. When he saw Laiyang Sheng, he got up and said, "I have been waiting for you for a long time, this is my home, please take a seat inside." Then he took Laiyang Sheng's hand, invited him inside, and eagerly expressed his gratitude to him. He took out a golden cup and a hundred pearls, which he had brought to the palace, and said, "I have nothing else of value, so I will take these as my bride-price." He also said, "The family has a thin wine, this is something from the underworld, it is not enough to entertain the guests, I am very sorry." Lai Yang Sheng said a few polite words, and said goodbye. Zhu Sheng sent him halfway before the two parted.
                When Lai Yang Sheng returned to his residence, the monks and servants of the monastery came to ask him. Lai Yang Sheng hid the truth and said, "It's nonsense to say it was a ghost, I went to my friend's house to drink." Five days later, Zhu Sheng did come. He was neatly dressed, with a fan in his hand, as if very satisfied. When he walked into the courtyard, he saluted Lai Yang Sheng from a distance. A moment later, Zhu Sheng smiled and said, "Your marriage has been agreed, and the auspicious date is set for tonight. Then I'll bother you." Lai Yang Sheng said, "Since I haven't heard back, the bride price has not yet been sent, so how can I hurry to hold the wedding?" Zhu Sheng said, "I have already sent it on your behalf." Lai Yang Sheng was grateful and went with him.
                The two of them went straight to Zhu Sheng's residence, where his niece, dressed in a gorgeous dress, greeted him with a smile. Lai Yang Sheng asked, "When did you get married?" Zhu Sheng replied, "Three days ago." She gave her niece the pearls that Zhu Sheng had given her as a dowry, but she refused to accept them. The niece said to Lai Yang Sheng, "I have conveyed my uncle's wishes to the old lady Gongsun, and she was very happy. But she also said: she is old, there are no other children at home, and does not want to marry Jiu Niang far away. Tonight, let you join the family. Her family has no men, Zhu Lang accompanied you." So Zhu Sheng led Lai Yang Sheng and went away. When they reached the end of the village, the door of a house was open, and Zhu and Lai entered the hall. A moment later, someone sent a message saying, "The old lady has arrived!" But I saw two maids helping an old lady up the steps. Lai Yangsheng went forward to bow down, but Madam Gongsun said, "I am already old, so it is not convenient for me to return the salute, so let's dispense with this ritual. She assigned her servants to set up a sumptuous banquet. Zhu Sheng also asked the servants to prepare some additional food and wine especially for Lai Yang Sheng. The dishes on display at the banquet were just like those in the human world. But the host poured his own drink and never persuaded the guests. After a while, the banquet broke up, and Zhu Sheng said goodbye and went back. A small maid led the way for Lai Yang Sheng. Entering the cave room, I saw red candles shining high, Jiu Niang dressed in gorgeous clothes, gazing at the waiting. The two met with deep friendship and extreme human intimacy.
                At first, Jiuniang's mother and son were captured and originally prepared to be escorted to the capital. When they arrived in Jinan, their mother could not bear the pain of abuse and died. In her grief and anger, Jiuniang also killed herself. Jiu Niang and Lai Yang Sheng talked about the past on their pillows and cried so much that they could not sleep, so they recited two stanzas: "In the past, my clothes were turned into dust, and I hated my predecessors for their karma. The moon in the maple forest has been cold for ten years, and this night is the first time to meet the spring in the painting pavilion." "Who would have thought that the balcony would become a cloud? Suddenly, I opened the golden box to look at it, and the blood was still staining the old dress." As dawn approached, Jiuniang urged Lai Yang-sheng, "You should leave this place and take care not to disturb the servants." Since then, Lai Yang Sheng came before dark and left just after dawn, and the two were deeply in love.
                One night, Lai Yang Sheng asked Jiuniang, "What is the name of this village?" Jiuniang said, "It is called Lai Xia Li. Because here are just buried Laiyang, Qixia, two counties of the new ghost, so this name." After hearing this, Lai Yang Sheng sighed and lamented. Jiu Niang said sadly: "I am a wisp of a ghost thousands of miles away, drifting in the bottomless abyss, mother and son are lonely and lonely, it is sad to say. I hope you can remember the kindness of husband and wife, collect my bones and move them back to your ancestral grave, so that I have support after a hundred years, then I will die without hate." Lai Yang Sheng agreed. Jiuniang said, "People and ghosts are not the same road, you should not stay here for a long time." She took out a pair of socks and gave them to Lai Yang Sheng, waving her tears and urging him to leave. Leyang Sheng walked out sadly, with a sad heart, lost in thought, depressed and anxious, and could not bear to go back. When he passed by Zhu Sheng's door, he knocked on Zhu Sheng's door, and Zhu Sheng came out barefoot and greeted Lai Yang Sheng. His niece also got up, her hair was unkempt, and asked in surprise what was going on. The niece asked in surprise what was going on. Lai Yangsheng was despondent for a while and told her what Jiu Niang had said. After listening, her niece said: "Even if my aunt did not say this, I have been thinking about this matter day and night. This is not a human world, and it is indeed inappropriate to live here for a long time." So we all wept, and Lai Yang-sheng said goodbye with tears in his eyes.
                When he returned to his apartment, Lai Yang Sheng tossed and turned and could not sleep until dawn. He wanted to look for the grave of Jiu Niang. But when he left, he forgot to ask the marker of the tomb. When he went there again in the dark, he saw a lot of barren graves and a lot of tarragon, so he lost the way to Laixia. When he opened the socks given by Jiu Niang, they were shattered by the wind, just like burnt paper ashes. So, Lai Yang Sheng returned to the east with a full set of clothes.
                Half a year later, Lai Yang Sheng could not forget this incident and came to Jinan again, hoping to have another chance to meet Jiuniang. When he arrived at the southern suburbs, it was already late. He parked the carriage under a tree in the temple, and hurried to the cluster of graves. He saw the barren graves, connected by a thousand, the thorns and barren grasses, the flickering ghost fires and the ghastly foxes, making people frightened. Lai Yang Sheng returned to his apartment with a frightened feeling.
                This time Jinan's pleasure completely disappeared, he immediately returned to the east. When he reached a mile, he saw a woman walking alone among the high and low graves. From the physical appearance, it looks very much like Jiu Niang. Lai Yang Sheng waved his whip and hurried up, and when he saw it, it was indeed Jiuniang. Lai Yang Sheng jumped off his horse to talk to her, the girl even walked away, as if they never met. Lai Yang Sheng rushed up again, the girl had an angry face, raised her sleeve to cover her face. Lai Yangsheng called out repeatedly, "Jiuniang! Nine-niang!" But the girl disappeared like light smoke.
                Different historians say: Qu Yuan threw himself into the Miluo River, unable to stop his grief and anger; Prince Shen Sheng suffered from slander, unable to redress his grievances. Since ancient times, there are filial sons and loyal subjects, but to the death can not be forgiven by their own monarch father. Is Gongsun Jiuniang because Lai Yang Sheng failed her request to bury the bones and resent him can not be forgiven? The endless sorrow and grievances in her heart cannot be shown to others, it is really wrong!

                Liang Gong, a general of Yangzhou, resigned from his post and lived in the countryside, carrying chess and wine with him every day to play among the green forests and green hills. On the ninth day of the ninth month of the year, he was playing chess with his guests for fun. Suddenly, a man came and wandered around the chess game and refused to leave. Liang Gong looked at him, and he looked very shabby and simple, with many patches hanging on his clothes. But his manners were gentle and elegant, and he had the manners of a literati. He bowed to him before he sat down, and was very modest. The Duke of Liang pointed to him and said, "You must be very good at Go, why don't you play against your guest?" He pushed back very politely for a while before he started playing against the guest. After the first game he lost, looking chagrined and anxious, as if he could not control himself. When he lost again, he was even more annoyed and ashamed. Liang Gong poured wine for him, but he didn't drink it either, he just dragged the guest to continue playing chess. From the morning until the sun went west, he did not have time to pee.
                While the two sides kept arguing over a chess piece, suddenly the scholar left his seat and stood there in fear, looking miserable and dejected. In a short while, he knelt down on his knees to Liang Gong's seat, knocked his forehead and asked him to save himself. Surprised and puzzled, he got up to help him and said, "It was just a game, why do you have to do this?" The scholar said, "Please ask the Duke of Liang to tell the prison guards not to bind my neck." The Duke of Liang found him even more strange and asked, "Who is the prison guard?" He replied, "Ma Cheng."
                It turned out that before that, Ma Cheng, the prison guard of Liang Gong, was taken away by the impermanent, and often entered the netherworld once every ten days, holding the paperwork of the underworld as a hooker. Liang Gong thought the scholar's words were peculiar, so he sent someone to see Ma Cheng, who had been lying stiffly in bed for two days. Liang Gong then scolded Ma Cheng must not be rude to the scholar. In the twinkling of an eye, the scholar fell down and disappeared. Liang Gong sighed in amazement for a long time, then realized that the scholar turned out to be a ghost.
                After a day, Ma Cheng woke up, and Lord Liang summoned him to ask about this. Ma Cheng said, "The scholar is from Huxiang, he is a chess player and has lost all of his family's money. His father was so worried about him that he kept him in his study, but he always went out over the wall and secretly hid himself in a deserted place, and continued to have intimate relations with people who liked to play chess. When his father heard of this, he scolded him, but in the end he could not stop him, and he died of anger and sorrow. The King of Hell reduced the scholar's life span because of his immorality and sent him to the prison of hungry ghosts, which has been seven years now. It coincided with the completion of the Phoenix Tower of Dongyue, and a notice was issued to all the hells to call for literati to write inscriptions. The king of hell let the scholar out of his prison and asked him to go forward to answer the call to atone for his sins. Unexpectedly, he delayed on his way and broke the deadline. The Dongyue Emperor sent the official on duty and the King of Hell to ask for his punishment. The King of Hell was furious and sent us to launch a search for him. We received your instructions the day before yesterday, so we did not dare to bind him with ropes." Lord Liang asked, "What is his condition today?" Ma Cheng said, "Still being delivered to the jailer, there is no more time limit for his survival forever." Duke Liang sighed and said, "How can a fetish mislead people to such an extent!"
                Ishi said, "When he saw the game of chess, he forgot that he was dead; when he died, he saw the game of chess and forgot that he had a chance to be reborn in the next life. Does this not mean that his hobby is more important than his life? However, if he has not learned to play chess to such a great extent, he can only make more chess ghosts who do not want to be reborn in the next life. It's really sad!

                There was a country farmer named Wang Mao Cai in Bo Yi who got up in the morning and went to work in the fields. Wang Maocai saw a small child, about four or five years old, with a beautiful face and a clever way of talking and laughing. Wang Maocai took the child to his home and raised him as his son, and found that the child was much smarter than ordinary children. Four or five years later, a monk came to Wang Maocai's home. When the child saw the monk, he was so scared that he didn't know where to hide.
                The monk told Wang Mao Cai, "This child is one of the five hundred little dragons in the pond of Mount Hua and escaped here privately." So the monk took out a bowl and filled it with water, only to see a small white snake swimming around in the bowl, the monk put the bowl into his sleeve and left Wang Maocai's house.

                Liu of Changshan, Shandong Province, was obese and loved to drink, and whenever he drank alone, he always drank up an urn. He had 300 acres of good land near the city, and often planted only half of the crops; but his family was very rich and did not suffer from his love of drinking.
                A monk from the West met Liu and said he was suffering from a strange disease. Liu replied, "No." The monk asked him, "Do you drink wine without ever getting drunk?" Liu said, "Yes." The monk said, "This is the presence of wine worms in your belly." Liu was very surprised and begged him for a cure. The monk said, "It is easy." Liu asked, "What medicine do I need?" The monk said that he didn't need any medicine, but just told him to lie down in the sun, tied his hands and feet; a pot of good wine was placed more than half a foot away from his head. After a while, Liu felt hot and thirsty, and wanted to drink wine very much. The nose smelled the fragrance of wine, and the craving fire burned upward, but suffered from not being able to drink wine. Suddenly felt a sudden itch in the throat, wow a spit out a thing, straight down to the wine basin. Untie the hands and feet to see, a red meat more than three inches long, like a swimming fish wriggling, mouth, eyes all. Liu was shocked and thanked the monk, taking silver to repay him, but the monk did not accept it, only requested for this wine worm. Liu asked him, "What is it for?" The monk replied, "It is the essence of wine, fill the urn with water, put the worm in and stir it, and it will become good wine." Liu asked the monk to test it, and it really was so.
                From then on, Liu disliked wine as an enemy, his body gradually lost weight, and his family became poorer and poorer, and finally he couldn't even eat. 
                Ishi said: Drinking one stone of wine a day did not cost him his wealth; not even one bucket of wine a day made him poorer: is there a fixed number of what people eat and drink? Some people say: The wine worm was Liu's lucky star and not the root of Liu's illness; that monk just wanted to get that wine worm and cheated him. Is that so? Is it not so?

In the mountain there is a god, who is shaped like a yellow skin, red as a flame, with six legs and four wings, and a chaotic head part, indistinguishable from his face, but he can sing and dance, which is actually Di Jiang.  Di Jiang is one of the ancient beasts, Chaos, is the central emperor of the sky. Chaos's skin is as red as fire, but no face. The skin of Chaos was as red as fire, but there was no face. Suddenly Khu often went to his place to play, and every time they went there, Chaos would treat them with great care. Suddenly Khu was very grateful, so they talked together about how to repay Chaos for his friendship. They said, "Everyone has ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, so that they can see, hear, and eat, but Chaos has nothing. So they got an axe, a chisel, and other tools to chisel the seven orifices for Chaos. They chiseled one day, and after seven days, they finally chiseled the seven trunks, and Chaos died.
